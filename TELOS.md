Proposed solution- create an inventory system app for Nabill that tracks and organizes data based on input based variables

**Technical** - is it possible?
-Using Python
-All storage and input functions are possible based on what I know how to do in python
-To create representations of data of tools in easy-to-read way, matplotlib can be utilized to create a data point graph.
-I have a computer, my client also has a modern computer.
Is it feasible? Yes, there is little limitation here due to our technology.

**Economic** is it possible?
-My client is a friend, I will not be payed to develop this program, and no outsourcing of resources that will cost money is necessary.
-The python editor we use, pycharm was acquired for free.
-Because of the point above, the cost to develop and distribute this program is 0$
Is it feasible? Yes, there is no cost to develop program, no problem whatsoever.

**Legal** is it possible?
-As long as I do not plagiarize a source code from another program, the program I make will be legal.
-Also, tech crew information is not classified, not illegal information for me to obtain.
Is it feasible? Yes, no forseen legal issues whatsoever.

**Operational** is it possible?
-I will have to instruct my client, Nabill on basic procedures of using my program
-I intend for the inputs and usage of program to be simple, so teaching usage should be simple
-My client is savvy to technology and needs no introduction to using a program
Is it feasible? Yes, minimal instruction is needed for client usage of app.

**Scheduling** is it possible?
-We will have ample time to develop our apps
-There is no strict deadline in which I must complete my app for client, deadline only comes from class
Is it feasible? Yes, I am confident with my ability to finish the program before deadline


**In conclusion**
Minimal issues percieved in TELOS throughout development of program. This project is feasible
