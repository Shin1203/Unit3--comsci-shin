# Criteria A


## The Client- 
Tech Crew Club Member Nabill Nuqman
## The Problem 
As a member of the tech crew, Nabill often suffers due to the lack of keeping track of equipment, and the club struggles to keep track of things, and also loses equipment. They need a way to keep inventory and data on their equipment.
## Proposed Solution
- Develop an app for the client which will act as a database, and will store all the tech crew equipment information, allowing users to edit information, as well as access it with ease.
-The app will fill all requirements for client, and make checking inventory of tech crew easy, as well as being able to record and store information
-Python will be used for the app, as it is a versatile language and is compatible with an interface designer app- qt designer, and will allow for importing functions into the app.
## Success Criteria:
1.)Exclusively for tech crew members- login/password
2.) The app can properly store info on which items tech crew has/does not have, the information here can be easily accessed and edited by user
3.) The app allows for a user to record when equipment have been used in the past, information is neatly stored and easily accessed
4.) Condition of each item is also stored and able to be edited in app
5.) Which equipment needs to be used at certain event is stored
6.) App should be easy to use, and only requires simple instructions
Developer plan- client will be involved in the entire process of development, giving feedback, wants complaints etc. 

# Development
---------------
User login feature steps

Registration
1.)Input username
2.)Input password
3.)confirm password
4.)generate salt
5.)use the hash lib function
6.) store info user_dict

Prototype 1 for user interface on Qtdesigner
-Main Menu/login
![Mainmenu](Mainwindow.png.png)
-List view of equipment
![secondmenu](seconwindow.png.png)
-Equipment information page
![thirdmenu](thirdwindow.png.png)

**USER FEEDBACK and Revision**

-Add "Functioning?" descriptor in table view of equipments, as well in equipment information view

-Create new "events" window, where upcoming events and previous events can be listed, store information of equipment too.

-Retitle all widgets to seperate and clearly identify during coding

In your role of a developer: read the client statement and write a draft version for the Criteria for Success in order of priority: most to least important.  Measurable, Specific, Non-trivial
