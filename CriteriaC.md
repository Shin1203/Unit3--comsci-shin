# Development

## Importing user interface into python
-To start coding the user interfaces created on Qtdesigner, I will have to import the .ui files as python files into my pycharm project.

-To do this, I saved the .ui interface files into the location of my pycharm project, then used the "pyuic5" command to convert them from .ui files to .py files.

-e.g ``pyuic5 mainmenu.ui -o mainmenu.py``
